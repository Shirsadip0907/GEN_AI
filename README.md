ðŸ¤– NexusForge: Advanced AI Development Framework
Overview
NexusForge is a Streamlit application that simulates a complete software development team using AI agents. Each agent specializes in a different role of the software development lifecycle, allowing you to rapidly prototype and develop software projects with minimal human intervention.

Features
Complete Development Lifecycle: Takes projects from initial requirements through design, development, testing, and review phases
Specialized AI Agents: Utilizes AI agents for different roles including Project Lead, Business Analyst, Designer, Developer, and Tester
Interactive Interface: Streamlit-based UI that allows for real-time interaction and feedback at each development phase
Artifact Management: Automatically generates and manages development artifacts throughout the project lifecycle
Chat Interface: Direct communication with the Project Lead agent for questions and guidance
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
pip package manager
Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-virtual-development-pod.git
cd ai-virtual-development-pod
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create a .env file in the project root with your API keys:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
Usage
Start the application:

streamlit run app.py
The application will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501

Navigate through the different tabs and phases of development:

Project Management: Guide the project through each development phase
Artifacts: View and download generated project artifacts
Chat: Communicate directly with the Project Lead agent
Development Workflow
Initialization Phase:

Enter project name, description, and business requirements
The Project Lead agent will generate an initial project outline
Requirements Analysis Phase:

The Business Analyst agent generates user stories based on the project outline
Provide feedback to refine the user stories as needed
Design Phase:

The Designer agent creates a comprehensive design document
Review and provide feedback to refine the design
Development Phase:

The Developer agent generates code implementation based on design and requirements
Review and provide feedback to improve the code
Testing Phase:

The Tester agent creates a test plan and executes tests against the implementation
Review test results and address any issues
Review Phase:

The Project Lead agent provides a comprehensive project review
Start a new project or continue refining the current one

Customization
Adding New Agents
To add a new specialized agent:

Create a new file in the agents/ directory
Define the agent class with appropriate methods
Update the imports and agent initialization in app.py
Modifying the Workflow
You can customize the development workflow by:

Adding or removing phases in the sidebar selection
Modifying the tasks given to agents
Creating new artifact types
Troubleshooting
API Key Issues: Ensure your API keys are correctly set in the .env file
Memory Errors: If you encounter memory issues with large projects, try reducing the model's temperature or tokens
Missing Task Import: If you encounter a "Task not defined" error, ensure you've imported Task from the crewai package
